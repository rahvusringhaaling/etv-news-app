# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 12 and Electron 13 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Node v14.17.5
- Angular v13.2.2
- Electron v16.0.0
- Electron Builder v22.13.1

With this sample, you can:

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

/!\ Angular 12.x CLI needs Node 11 or later to work correctly.

## Getting Started

*Clone this repository locally:*

``` bash
git clone https://gitlab.err.ee/eetrigraafika/portaalid-2022.git
```

*Install dependencies with npm (used by Electron renderer process):*

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

*Install NodeJS dependencies with npm (used by Electron main process):*

``` bash
cd app/
npm install
```

Why two package.json ? This project follow [Electron Builder two package.json structure](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure) in order to optimize final bundle and be still able to use Angular `ng add` feature.

*Install Svelte dependencies with npm (used for CasparCG template):*

``` bash
cd svelte/
npm install
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload!

The application code is managed by `app/src/main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200), and an Electron window. \
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import. \
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `app/src/main.ts`.

## Project structure

|Folder|Description|
| ---- | ---- |
| app | Electron main process folder (NodeJS) |
| src | Electron renderer process folder (Web / Angular) |

## How to import 3rd party libraries

This sample project runs in both modes (web and electron). To make this work, **you have to import your dependencies the right way**. \

There are two kind of 3rd party libraries :
- NodeJS's one (like an ORM, Database...)
    - Used in electron's Main process (app folder) have to be added in `dependencies` of `app/package.json`
    - Used in electron's Renderer process (src folder) have to be added in `dependencies` of both `app/package.json` and `src/package.json`

Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of libraries has to be done when using NodeJS / 3rd party libraries in renderer context (i.e. Angular).

- Web's one (like bootstrap, material, tailwind...)
    - It have to be added in `dependencies` of `src/package.json`

## Add a dependency with ng-add

You may encounter some difficulties with `ng-add` because this project doesn't use the defaults `@angular-builders`. \
For example you can find [here](HOW_TO.md) how to install Angular-Material with `ng-add`.

## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:build`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable based on your operating system |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and NodeJS dependencies are included in the final bundle.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

YES! You can do it! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies section of `app/package.json` with `npm install --save XXXXX`. \
It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to your final bundle. \
Then use your library by importing it in `app/src/main.ts` file. Quite simple, isn't it?

## E2E Testing

E2E Test scripts can be found in `e2e` folder.

|Command|Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|`npm run e2e`| Execute end to end tests |

Note: To make it work behind a proxy, you can add this proxy exception in your terminal  
`export {no_proxy,NO_PROXY}="127.0.0.1,localhost"`

## Debug with VSCode

[VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) debug configuration is available! In order to use it, you need the extension [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome).

Then set some breakpoints in your application's source code.

Finally from VsCode press **Ctrl+Shift+D** and select **Application Debug** and press **F5**.

Please note that Hot reload is only available in Renderer process.
